dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:26:58,0,1,0,"Well if you don't have a full lineup projected and a plan to replace these guys, slow down on proposing these things.  I agree with you, but until there's a good plan behind it."
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:24:37,0,1,0,"I have no clue. First things first is get rid of Backes and Mcquaid. Trade or buy them out. Gotta clean the cap a bit and stop recruiting these ""enforcers""."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:24:36,0,0,0,Then what's your lineup for next year?
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:24:18,0,0,0,"True, but at the same time it could be the opposite of that and there are many successes.  To be a true fan, you have to shallow the loses and enjoy the victories."
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:22:44,0,1,0,Good's not enough. It's not.
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:21:59,0,1,0,"You can't guarantee the future, I'm sure Caps fans thought ten years ago they were going to win a cup and look at the time in between. You can't guarantee anything in the NHL."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:20:56,0,2,0,What's your lineup for next year?
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:20:37,0,2,0,"Obviously they all not great lines, but they're all good lines.  The 4th line is a 4rd line on some teams, the 2nd line needs more stability at 2RW, and the 3rd line needs work."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:19:42,0,1,0,Now that's being pessimistic.  Why invest in a team if you don't tolerate their loses?
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:19:21,0,1,0,"The Bruins don't have four great lines. They're a first/second round level playoff team. They don't have the depth, the coaching staff, enough young polished players to be contenders. They have so many guys to get rid of, still a lot of shaky players, it won't be enough."
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:17:18,0,1,0,Oh sure ten years from now they might win a cup but that's copping out. I might be dead in two years why would I care.
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:16:41,0,1,0,"And like I said, it's very possible within the next few years for another banner to be raised, but it can't be rushed."
losstonruins,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:16:35,4,2,1,"they were beaten by a better team, so don't enjoy the accomplishments of the season? every season that ends with not winning the cup should just be forgotten forever? i don't get it"
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:14:40,0,1,0,"Yes it is ! The fans deserve more than one Cup, and the Jacobs have 1 championship in 45 years. That doesn't cut it !! I'm tired of seeing guys like Raymond Bourquue win nothing here and having to play elsewhere to win a cup. This core needs two."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:14:01,0,1,0,"I agree we need to win non, but you're rushing it.  Next year and especially in two years the Bruins will be absolute cup contenders.  Just be patient, it makes victory all more sweet."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:13:02,0,0,0,But if you watched them at the Worlds (which I was able to do somewhat) you would understand they're actually a very powerful duo.  And DeBrusk 30 points?  Are you ignoring that he just had 43 in 70 games during his rookie campaign?  He's only going to get better.
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:12:03,0,1,0,"You're the one wowing yourself over 112 pts! I'm just saying not long ago they had a great regular season, who cares, a 46 win team can still win the cul, Vegas had 109 pts this season. They need to win now and get back to where they used to in 2013. It has to happen now."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:11:40,0,0,0,"Obviously not, but I'm optimistic considering the physicality of the NHL is somewhat declining.  Only thing stopping Bergeron are his injuries."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:10:53,0,1,0,"And that's okay.  If we don't win the cup it doesn't mean the team's a failure.  Yes, the season is literally a failure but looking at expectations and the injuries we had, you cannot complain.  We won six straight with a quarter of our starting lineup out at one point."
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:10:38,0,1,0,You can't guarantee that.
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:09:43,0,1,0,"Pastrnak with Krejci ? No, no, that's getting cute, he's a first liner the first line is the strength of this team. Just build a better 2nd line, Debrusk is too raw, more of a 30 pt player."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:09:39,0,1,0,"Don't worry, unlike Krejci, Bergeron's decline is going to be very slow.  I say he's got at least 4-5 more years of top-line production."
MarkDav50555018,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:09:13,0,0,0,Agreed..I'm not getting drawn in
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:08:41,0,1,0,"Stop looking at the past, 117 points is very hard to get.  And the Bruins could possibly top that next year, with the way all our prospects are developing.  You aren't grateful."
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:07:39,0,1,0,For ten years it was always the same teams winning the cup anyways. Except for this year.
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:06:39,0,1,0,I don't care about any of these players. What concerns me is Bergeron's remaining prime.
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:06:00,0,1,0,"But who cares ? Four years ago they had 117, who cares about 50 wins they had 54 in 2014, and most people thought they were a 96 pt team but it wasn't rebuild, it was missing the playoffs, then trading away players and cleaning the cap. But still have many bad contracts"
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:05:25,0,1,0,And that's why next season it's very likely Pastrnak is paired with DeBrusk and Krejci and the speedy-Bjork takes his spot.  Krejci and Pastrnak looked awesome together at the Worlds and that's a very powerful six 6 if it happens.
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:04:19,0,1,0,Look at how long it's taking other teams to rebuild.
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:04:07,0,2,0,"Ok?  This year we had 112, and most people weren't even expecting us to get out of a wild-card spot.  And why are you acting like we didn't go through a rebuild?  More importantly, why aren't you happy like the rest of us fans that the rebuild took only two years?"
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:03:32,0,1,0,"Am I the GM of this team ? This is those guy's jobs I'm not going to do the job for them, but the reality is they either have to buy out or trade. Not having two great lines is killing them. You can't put all the pressure on one line and hope they can bail you all the time"
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:01:31,0,1,0,"That's where development comes in, and you have to be patient.  Other guys like McAvoy, DeBrusk, Grzelcyk, and Heinen all developed quite a bit this year.  Carlo needs more work, but that doesn't mean you dump him."
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:01:18,0,1,0,"Dude four years ago they registered 117 pts, last season they got balled out by Ottawa and all these breakaways but you speak of patience but they're running out of it! Bergeron's prime is being wasted, they need another run here."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 23:00:32,0,1,0,"They can't trade Krejci or Backes, their contracts have a NMC in them.  I'm fine with getting rid of McQuaid and buying out Backes when it's possible.  Who would you replace all these guys with?"
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:59:36,0,1,0,"He wouldn't stop delivering centering passes even under Greg Gallant, just move on from him. He can hardly bodycheck. He's just good enough for the pros. Or for a team wanting to make a run."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:57:46,0,0,0,"And what you're saying was true in the playoffs, but not the regular season.  During the regular season all four lines got going."
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:57:40,0,1,0,"And he can develop all he want, just not on this team anymore! They need to dump Krejci, Backes, Krug, Mcquaid. Need better players, more durable. Need to improve the 6 on 5 too. More blue liners and better passing. Lack of skating is also hurting the stretches of the back lines"
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:57:18,0,2,0,"This is what I mean, you don't blow it all up because we lost in the playoffs.  We got a round deeper this year and all our young guys and prospects got a lot of valuable experience.  Tampa was really good this year, too.  Don't take that from them."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:56:05,0,1,0,"That said, Carlo was this year's scapegoat.  Yes, he turned over the puck on notable plays, but he has decent potential as a 2nd pairing-puck carrier.  You need to be patient."
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:55:21,0,1,0,"They were carried by one great line but every NHL game is relative, and regular season doesn't translate to regular season. You saw the difference in levels between Tampa and Boston, Boston doesn't have that level. They need serious changes."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:55:05,0,2,0,"I'll admit, Carlo had a rough year, but all young players hit that rookie/sophomore wall.  But he's still developing, and it's said that it takes ~400 game the average NHL defenseman to stabilize, aside from young stars like McAvoy."
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:53:32,0,0,0,At least we can agree on that.  Gotta satisfy the corporate ticket-holders over the real fans.
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:53:23,0,1,0,So you're telling me that Carlo who turns the puck over all the time is NOT an AHL level player ? Got it !
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:52:33,0,0,0,You have no idea about this. You cannot guarantee it.
PatColonel99,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:52:11,0,1,0,Boston ? Yes. Bruins ? No. Can't root for the Jacobs.
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:41:45,0,1,0,"Also, why didn't you show other numbers that debunk mine?  The Bruins were 4th in GAA and 2nd in SA/GP.  Why are you ignoring this?"
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:40:37,0,0,0,You think Krug's injury was a soft one?
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:40:22,0,2,0,Do you watch AHL games?  I don't think you understand what the difference is between AHL-level players and developing NHL rookies.
dreamhockey37,@NHLBruins,2018-05-25 22:39:20,0,1,0,"I'm convinced he's a troll.  If there's seriously a Bruins fan behind his computer, it's certainly one that expects too much and clearly didn't really watch much this year."
