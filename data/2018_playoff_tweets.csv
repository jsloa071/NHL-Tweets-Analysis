ZachJensen45,@TBLightning,2018-05-19 23:59:19,0,2,0,If the trip is called the play is blown dead when Tampa touches the puck. Therefore they wouldn’t have been able to shoot the puck and score and the Caps would go on a power play. Do you not know how hockey works buddy?

And the Flyers only have 1Dman on the PP1. I would guess even the #3 will only ever get ~40 points max while Ghost is here. Likely that being Sanheim."
Symyro,@NHLFlyers,2018-05-05 18:38:58,1,1,0,"Honestly with guys like Ghost, Provorov and Sanheim we don't need Dmen that are gonna put up 50-60 points, a solid all around game with say 20-30 points would be a great thing to have"

Only question is his offensive upside. He has the skillset to be effective in OZ at least going forward... and Allsvenskan is good level."

ChrisMcClain,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:54:15,2,1,0,"I agree. My main point was how quickly they’ve attached to the Vegas landscape. I would’ve thought they’d play it cool until they go there, but that’s above my pay grade."
grid_dragon,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:52:47,0,1,0,"I dont think that's it... but the bottom line in all this is that HERE, the Sharks arent segmented due to being in San Jose. And the only team to ostracize them is the Raiders. I dont think any of us care. Raiders are just about gone. "
ChrisMcClain,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:51:56,1,0,0,Well I don’t think you can use Giants as an example since Oakland has a baseball team. They’d never do it out of loyalty to A’s... they’d be killed. But Bay doesn’t have another basketball or hockey team.
R8RtailG8R,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:50:03,0,2,0,Yeah perhaps. I just think it’s a coliseum love thing for the raiders as opposed to the Bay Area. Raiders could of taken out newspaper ads for giants & sharks in their recent championship games but they didn’t.. hence why I think that they only acknowledge dubs/A’s
grid_dragon,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:47:57,1,1,0,They are collaborative. They cant di ot without the Raiders participating. My hunch is the Raiders engagement has not been reciprocal. They rarely engaged with the A's so the A's stopped trying outside of Twitter.
R8RtailG8R,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:38:08,0,1,0,missing my point RJ. sharks have honoured every team in Bay Area with a team theme night except the silver and black and for a organisation like the raiders who holds grudges like no other... it’s just made sense for raiders to back the golden knights cause they petty like that
R8RtailG8R,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:32:32,0,0,0,I do hope we get to the point where the warriors advance to finals and we can see if the raiders do or don’t get that Bay Area newspaper of good luck or congratulations for the dubs

ChrisMcClain,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:28:21,0,0,0,It’s an Oakland thing except when it’s a Vegas thing and a Raider Nation thing... there’s a reason them wishing the Knights good luck when playoffs started didn’t sit well with many Raiders fans.
R8RtailG8R,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:25:43,0,3,0,"For the raiders it’s a oakland thing... they never took out advertisements for the sfgiants because they don’t share a stadium complex with them.

Also the sharks have done a Bay Area unite theme for every team except raiders so fuck them!"
ChrisMcClain,@SanJoseSharks,2018-05-27 21:22:47,0,0,0,My point is that this is for good publicity: show a union and allegiance to Vegas. Why would they take out a full page ad for a city’s team that they’re leaving?
